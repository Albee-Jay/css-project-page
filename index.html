          <h1>Albert R Juarez</h1>
          <h2>IT Full-Stack Web Dev Student</h2>

          <p>
            After nearly 27 years in the Casino Gaming Industry, the 2020
            calendar year flipped my life upside down. I am now studying to
            become a Full Stack Web Developer, a fast paced and
            ever changing field. Funnily enough, that describes the
            Gaming world as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought if I have to switch gears with my life, then let's do it big. So, I looked to the Coding / Dev world,
            because I am eager to learn, grow and show out. I've got great
            communication skills, I love paying attention to details and my
            listener capacity is unmatched. Below you'll learn a bit more about
            who I was, who I am and who I want to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, another big passion in life is being an Intuitive Card Reader,
            I love helping people figure things out with Tarot, Oracle or
            Lenormand card readings. Check out
            <a href="https://www.alstarot.com">Al's Tarot LLC</a> for more
            information.
